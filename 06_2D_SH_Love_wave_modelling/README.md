# 2D SH/Love wave finite-difference modelling

After solving the 2D acoustic wave equation with constant density, we focus in the next step on 2D elastic approximations. We begin with the 2D isotropic SH problem which is very similar to the acoustic problem 
but is an accurate elastic description of the subsurface.

### [Lesson 1](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/daniel-koehn/Theory-of-seismic-waves-II/tree/master/06_2D_SH_Love_wave_modelling/1_2D_SH_FD_staggered.ipynb): Solving the isotropic elastic 2D SH problem by the staggered grid FD method

I introduce the basics of a 2nd order in time and 2nd order in space staggered grid finite difference approach to solve the 2D elastic SH problem in stress-velocity formulation.
