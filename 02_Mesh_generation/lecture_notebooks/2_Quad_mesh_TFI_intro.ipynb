    "# Deformed Cartesian quad meshes by transfinite interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen in the previous lesson, the equidistant Cartesian grid has some serious limitations when an accurate approximation of layer interfaces is required. One possible solution are deformed Cartesian quad meshes, which are commonly used in the framework of the Spectral Element Method which we will cover in a later lecture. I want to illustrate this problem using an example I'm currently working on."

    "## Problem: Sea Dike with strong topography\n",
    "\n",
    "I have applied Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) to SH-data acquired on a sea dike at the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein in Northern Germany ([Köhn et al. 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324138422_Sea_dike_evaluation_by_SH_full_waveform_inversion)). To avoid problems with the Cartesian-grid discretization of the free-surface with strong topography used in the finite-difference forward modelling code, the model and acquisition geometry are rotated according to the topography and the FWI applied to a model with planar free surface. Finally, the FWI results are rotated back relative to the true sea dike topography. The resulting Vs-model shows some high- and low-velocity layers (Fig. 1), which can be related to sand and marine clay layers verified by borehole-profiles.\n",

    "\n",
    "This approach has the disadvantage, that we can not use the full dataset acquired over the full length of the dike, but have to restrict the FWI to sources and receivers on the tilted surfaces of the dike. Therefore, we want to replace the finite difference by a spectral element forward modelling engine, which can handle a model discretization using regular deformed quad meshes."
