# 2D acoustic finite-difference modelling

The 1D acoustic wave equation is very useful to introduce the general concept and problems related to FD modelling. However, for realistic modelling and seismic imaging/inversion applications we have to solve at least the 2D 
acoustic wave equation. In the following lessons we will develop a 2D acoustic modelling code, optimize it's performance and apply it to some benchmark problems. 

## Lecture 5: 2D acoustic finite-difference modelling

### [Lesson 1](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/daniel-koehn/Theory-of-seismic-waves-II/tree/master/05_2D_acoustic_FD_modelling/1_From_1D_to_2D_acoustic_FD_modelling_final.ipynb): From 1D to 2D acoustic finite difference modelling

Starting from the 1D acoustic code, we develop a 2D acoustic modelling code and compare the numerical with an analytical solution. While the 2D code can be implemented quite fast, the runtime of this implementation is quite bad.
