    "In the [last lesson](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/daniel-koehn/Theory-of-seismic-waves-II/blob/master/03_Intro_finite_differences/2_fd_ac1d.ipynb) we developed a 1D acoustic FD modelling code. For the given modelling parameters, the code worked flawlessly and delivered modelled seismograms, which are in good agreement with the analytical solution. In this lesson we want to investigate how to choose optimum time steps dt and spatial grid point distances dx, to get stable and accurate FD modelling results. We start, by revisiting a simplified version of our 1D acoustic FD modelling code ..."
